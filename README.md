# SnapGame
Snapgame 

Created the game app with 3 conditions to win the game:
Card face value - If Value of the card on two players matches,its as SNAP
Card Suit Vaue - If both the cards have same suit, SNAP happens
and Both -  if value and suit both are same, SNAP happens.

PLease note, I have not used any coding standard and design pattrens or unit testing.As specified, it was just a demo app. 

Game :
Please click on the deck of card in the middle of screen.This will show the card of the two players one by one and if match happens , SNAP image will come notifying which player wins. Win is decided on the total value of the cards collected with the player.
